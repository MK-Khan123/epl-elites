### `Project Features`

In this project, we practically applied the functional concepts of React routing. We fetched our data from [TheSportsDB.com](https://www.thesportsdb.com/api.php) and used route parameter to display data dynamically prompted through unique interaction. We accessed unique data using route parameter and generated dynamic URL to load and display data. In addition, we used conditional formatting and plain bootstrap inside the source code to make it more functional and device responsive. Furthermore, we deployed our site on Netlify which can be accessed through the above mentioned link to experience the website.

Thank you.
