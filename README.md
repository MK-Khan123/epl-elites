# English Premiere League Elites (React Router Assignment)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Netlify Live Site Link

The project was deployed at Netlify and the Live-Site-Link is here.

### `Project Features`

In this project, we practically applied the functional concepts of React routing. We fetched our data from [TheSportsDB.com](https://www.thesportsdb.com/api.php) and used route parameter to display data dynamically prompted through unique interaction. We accessed unique data using route parameter and generated dynamic URL to load and display data. In addition, we used conditional formatting inside the source code to make it more meaningful. Furthermore, we deployed our site on Netlify which can be accessed through the above mentioned link to experience the website.

Thank you.
